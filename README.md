Often the strongest glue for plastic may not be the best adhesive for plastic. There are a variety of factors to consider when choosing the best plastic glue. Obviously bond strength is at the top.

For most plastic bonding applications cyanoacrylate adhesives, UV curable adhesives, MMAs, as well as some epoxy and structural adhesives can be used. The large variety of adhesives available can make the selecting the best adhesive for plastic seem difficult.

To determine which adhesive for plastic will have the highest bond strength, it is often necessary to know the exact nature of the plastic. The type of plastic as well as the surface condition of that plastic.

Deepmaterial cyanoacrylate adhesive and most ABS (Acrylonitrile butadiene styrene), PMMA (acrylic), Nylon, Phenolic, Polyamide, Polycarbonate, PVC (both rigid and flexible).

For cyanoacrylate adhesive to show good bond strength on polyethylene or polypropylene Deepmaterial POP primer should be used first.

All Deepmaterial plastic bonding UV curable adhesives bond well to most ABS (Acrylonitrile butadiene styrene), Nylon, Phenolic, Polyamide, Polycarbonate, PVC (both rigid and flexible). Special plastic bonding UV curable adhesives are available for acrylic.

One part epoxy adhesives are generally not considered as the minimum cure temperature of the epoxy tends to be higher than the maximum temperature resistance of many plastics. Higher temperature resistant plastics such as PEEK and PBT can be bonded with special heat cure epoxy.

Two part epoxy adhesives can be used to bond certain plastics. Special grades of plastic bonding epoxy are available from Deepmaterial where high strength performance is required. Modified epoxy adhesives are two part epoxy adhesives that provide much higher flexibility than traditional two part epoxy adhesives.

Structural acrylics will also bond most plastics. Many types are available including surface activated, bead on bead, and two component. MMAs (methyl methacrylate adhesives) are an effective way of bonding plastic substrates and offer impressive adhesion strength â€“ often substrates break before the adhesive bond is broken.
